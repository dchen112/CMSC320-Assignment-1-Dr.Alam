Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: Developers use git as a version control tool. Using git allows developers to maintain multiple branches, which have different
variations of the same code. With git, developers can collaborate with others more easily because they can work simultaneously on the code
without overriding the changes of other developers. Additionally, developers can use git to restore old versions of code in the case where
code changes result in new bugs and errors.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science can be applied to many different fields, but one major field is healthcare. Data science can be used to analyze large
sets of patient data and predict patient outcomes. For example, machine learning models can be trained to predict which patients are at
higher risk of heart disease or diabetes based upon predictive factors like blood lipid levels or blood pressures.

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging and rebasing are similar in the fact that they are both used to integrate changes from one branch into another. They are both
used in the same situations, but the way that they work is different. Rebase rewrites the commit history to make it appear as though the
changes in the branch of the new feature start at the tip of the target branch. This means that there is no merge commit that dirties the
commit history. In the case of merge, the extra merge commit still appears, and the branching history is preserved.

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: During this course, I hope to improve my comfortability with large data sets and databases. In the past, I have worked briefly with
big data using simple SQL commands. By the end of this class, I want to be more proficient with language and overall capable of applying my
knowledge to real world projects.
