Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: Developers use git as a version control tool. Using git allows developers to maintain multiple branches, which have different
variations of the same code. With git, developers can collaborate with others more easily because they can work simultaneously on the code
without overriding the changes of other developers. Additionally, developers can use git to restore old versions of code in the case where
code changes result in new bugs and errors.
Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science can be applied to many different fields, but one major field is healthcare. Data science can be used to analyze large
sets of patient data and predict patient outcomes. For example, machine learning models can be trained to predict which patients are at
higher risk of heart disease or diabetes based upon predictive factors like blood lipid levels or blood pressures.
