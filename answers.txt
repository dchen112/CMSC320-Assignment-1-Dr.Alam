Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: Developers use git as a version control tool. Using git allows developers to maintain multiple branches, which have different
variations of the same code. With git, developers can collaborate with others more easily because they can work simultaneously on the code
without overriding the changes of other developers. Additionally, developers can use git to restore old versions of code in the case where
code changes result in new bugs and errors.
